# Customer Churn Analysis & Strategy Simulation

##  Objective
To identify interpretable behavioral rules that drive customer churn,
simulate possible interventions, and determine which customers should be targeted for retention strategies.

##  Methods
- Random Forest for feature selection
- Decision Tree for rule extraction
- Sensitivity analysis to quantify variable thresholds
- Targeting customer segmentation based on simulated impact

##  Key Insights
- Rule 207: Increasing `total_trans_ct` to 68 retains 54 customers
- Strategy: Trigger point-based campaigns for low-frequency users
